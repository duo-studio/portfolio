# Duo Studio

> Brand and web systems for established businesses ready to look as credible as they actually are—through strategic identity and custom-built digital experiences.

## About

Duo Studio is a digital design agency based in Baltimore, MD, founded in 2020. We partner with established businesses—professional services firms, creative studios, e-commerce brands, and mission-driven organizations—to craft brand systems and websites that finally match the caliber of work they do.

Your business has evolved. Your brand should reflect that. We help companies that have outgrown their current brand or website, whether they're repositioning, entering a new phase, or ready to invest in how they're perceived.

We don't use templates. Every brand system and website is custom-built from scratch.
