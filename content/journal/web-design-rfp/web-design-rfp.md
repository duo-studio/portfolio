<h2 id="rfp">The Website Design RFP (Request for Proposal)</h2>

An RFP is what it sounds like; it’s a document that announces an upcoming project, provides relevant details and requests potential vendors to bid on it. So in this case, if your business is writing a web design RFP, your document would have:

1. Cover page
2. Company background
3. Project overview
4. Project scope
5. Website examples
6. Existing website details
7. Budget
8. Timeline
9. Vendor specifications
10. Selection process
11. Submission directions

Your RFP should begin with an introduction of your company and an explanation of the project requirements. Providing helpful references, like your competitor's site or your existing website, will assist vendors visualize the goal. Next, clearly outline directions on submitting the RFP and the selection criteria. Provide details for each requirement in your RFP, enabling vendors to submit a perfect proposal for the job. If you do this well, your vendors will think "wow, this company knows what they want.” 

Be sure to download our website design RFP template below to guide you through the process!

<h2 id="cover-page">1. Cover Page</h2>

Don't underestimate the significance of the front page in your website design RFP! It's the first impression your potential vendors will have of your company, so establish the groundwork immediately. Include the RFP’s title, submission date and some brief information on where and who they will submit their responses to. The cover page also acts as a filter for vendors who might have accessed this file passed the due date.

**Google Search Tip:** If you do this, Google will pull the text on your cover page and show the information in the meta description:

<h2 id="overview">3. Project Overview: Setting Clear Project Goals</h2>

Clearly communicate your vision with the project, focusing on what your current site lacks and what you’re trying to achieve with your new site. Help design agencies understand the desired outcome as they're reading through the rest of your RFP. There's a lot that you can say when it comes to your business and its current challenges. Don't worry if you're noticing this section becoming bulky - it might be tough unraveling your business' pain points but it helps tremendously when you're writing your website design RFP. By communicating your pain points to your vendors, it'll set you up for success in the collaboration since you’re already aligned.

### Brief

Provide a quick snapshot of the project to help agencies grasp the context and scale so they understand your goals and capabilities. Keep it brief and focus on the big picture at first - you’ll go into more details later.

### Challenges

Now you want to get into the specifics about the challenges you’re facing with the website. Identify problem areas that are preventing your business from performing at the best level. Whether it’s load speed, functionality, or design, it’s important to be as concise with this section as possible. It helps agencies understand your expectations and provide targeted proposals to fit your needs.

### Goals

Finally, you want to let your vendors know what would make this project a success. Include an all-encompassing statement that highlights what the new website should be able to do. Remember to also provide a list of general capabilities that will solve your challenges. If you find that this section is getting too overwhelming, it might be a good idea to separate items into “must haves” and “nice to haves”.

Again, refer to the template for examples.

<h2 id="scope">4. Project Scope: Technical Specifications</h2>

After you've exhausted your business' problems, now it's time to solve them (or at least try to). We use the word "try" because good digital agencies will reject certain demands if they believe it won't get you your intended results. Agencies hold the expertise to separate the things you want from the things you need, including unnecessary design requests or overcomplicated development features. Keep in mind the primary focus for web design projects is to create an engaging and user-friendly online presence with improved branding. It’s beneficial to break the scope into different categories.

### Design

Share the visual elements of your brand and preferred content with potential web design companies, including materials from your current brand guidelines or marketing resources. This helps vendors grasp your brand’s identity and ensures a consistent and recognizable look on your new website, thus streamlining the design process.

### Sitemap & Architecture

Once you've provided the visual direction, the next step is to define the existing web pages and to decide if you want to add pages. Feel free to simplify this list by highlighting the top-level pages unless there are important requirements in the sub-pages. Naturally, you’ll end up with a list that’s essentially your sitemap. No need to get fancy need to get fancy with diagrams, a simple list of your current and desired additional pages will work. 

A well-crafted RFP includes specific requirements for your site architecture and templating system.

### Technology

In this section, we'll go over web development based features that you may add in your website design RFP. Try not to make it too technical, the development team will find the solutions. Instead, focus on highlighting specific requirements you need to solve your business goals.

### Content Management System (CMS)

If you have an internal team responsible for managing the content of your site, mention this in your website design RFP. Inform your vendors about your existing CMS and expectations for the new website. 

### Third-Party Integrations

Do you have a CRM for your digital marketing? Do you want to have a map embed on your new site? Or does your business require specific user authentication for logins? List out all the third-party integrations connected to your site and consider additional features you want. Be clear about these specific requirements and triple check this so you don’t leave out important integrations. 

### Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

You've probably heard of SEO before and it’s an important feature to think about when considering a new website. SEO is the practice of enhancing a website to increase its visibility on search engines and there are many factors involved, like on-page, off-page, local and keyword optimization. Be clear about the functionality requirements - feel free to learn more about it [here](https://moz.com/learn/seo/what-is-seo){target="_blank"}. As you're writing your RFP, include any existing metrics and what goals you'd like to achieve for the search engine result pages (SERPs). Let your vendors know that you want to rank above your competitors or just higher than where you are now.

### Security and Maintenance

It would be a shame to go through an entire website project just to end up with a crashed or hacked site. While digital agencies typically follow security protocols, you can reinforce this by setting clear expectations. Specify if you'll need SSL certificates, firewalls, and/or scheduled updates. This leads to the topic of maintenance. 

Do you have an internal team that can of manage website files or backups? If you do, provide a list of requirements for the access they'll need. If you don’t, be transparent on whether you expect the selected vendor to handle site maintenance. Keep in mind that this impacts the budget.

Now that you have your professionally written RFP, you'll need vendors to send them to. You might have a list of companies that you're excited to work with but, if you don't, find, stalk and reach out to them.

- **Google** - Google is a great resource to look for vendors, especially if  you prefer to work with a local agency. Give it a try! Hop on Google, do a quick search, check out their reviews and proximity to you. If they are nearby, in-person meetings are valuable.
- **Directory sites** - There are a bunch of directories from Clutch, Awwwards and Crunchbase where you can find agencies and their portfolio of work.
- **Social media** - Social media is another great tool to research potential vendors. This can also be used as an extension of the previous examples. For example, you can find agencies on Google or Awwwards and continue learning about them from their social profiles.
- **Word of mouth** - Have a friend that recently worked a digital design agency? Or are you a part of a group or online forums? Reach out to them to learn about that company and what it was like working with a digital agency.

Your design project is important and you want to engage with the right company to handle your project. With numerous methods available for reaching out to agencies, pick a few that feels best for you!
