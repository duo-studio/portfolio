## Working remotely = too much freedom?

In today’s digital age, working remotely in another country is now possible and there are many opportunities to explore different countries. So how do you stay on top of your work?

### Set up your distraction free workspace

Make sure you’re nice and comfy, have good lighting and the necessary tools to be connected to your clients and teams. Some tools we like are:

- [Slack](https://slack.com/){target="_blank"} for daily internal communication
- [monday.com](http://monday.com){target="_blank"} for project management
- [Zoom](https://zoom.us/){target="_blank"} for client and team meetings
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/){target="_blank"} for team collaboration

### Create a routine

A solid routine will do wonders for your day: you’ll increase your efficiency, minimize your stress levels, be on top of you time management and feel completely in-control of your day. 

### Your health comes first

A mantra that we like to share with our team. Don’t be afraid to take necessary breaks to avoid burnout - we’ve all been there. What good is exploring another country if you’re stressed from work?

## Work anywhere, thrive everywhere

While beach laptop pictures on the internet have received some criticism, it's important to recognize the benefits of remote work for both employers and employees.

### Increased productivity

Office water cooler chats or impromptu meetings can be time consuming! These things can be distracting and prevent team members from focusing on their task and deliver high quality work.

### Flexibility

Whether you’re a night-owl or early-bird it doesn’t matter when working remotely - just choose your productive hours and get in that flow state.

### Save money

Companies can save money on office space and commuting expenses. Also, with a global pool of talent, they’re able to work with anyone, no matter their location.

### Sustainability

With remote work reducing commuter traffic, there’s a significant decrease in carbon emissions therefore contributing positively to global environment conservation efforts. Cheers to a greener, more sustainable future.

## Navigating the roadblocks

There are so many benefits of working remotely but it does come with its fair share of challenges. From communication barriers to maintaining healthy work-life balance, remote work requires strategies and adaptability to overcome these obstacles.

### Communication barriers

While tools like Slack and Zoom can bridge the gap between communication issues, there’s still non-verbal cues that can lead to misunderstanding. Another thing to keep in mind is each team member’s time-zone with scheduling. In a traditional office setting, collaboration and communication is straightforward.

### Work vs play

Remote work may blur the lines between your personal and professional time, making it challenging to maintain a healthy work-life balance. That’s why it’s important to set up your perfect productivity workspace.

### Social isolation

According to [Buffer](https://buffer.com/state-of-remote-work/2022){target="_blank"}, 24% of remote workers struggle with loneliness when working from home. The absence of daily face-to-face interactions can lead to feelings of isolation, especially if you spend most of your time working alone. To address this, some companies do virtual coffee dates or online games to foster a sense of connection.

Even considering these challenges, we’re expecting a continuous, gradual shift toward remote working. And [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/press/releases/upwork-study-finds-22-of-american-workforce-will-be-remote-by-2025){target="_blank"} finds that 22% of the American workforce will be remote by 2025.

## Best of both worlds? The hybrid approach

A hybrid home-office is a flexible approach that combines working in the office and working from home. Currently, about 74% of employers offer hybrid work environments, according to a recent [survey](https://www.ifebp.org/store/employee-benefits-survey/Pages/default.aspx){target="_blank"}. Let’s take a look at some variations:

1. Office-home - in this model, team members have the flexibility to work in the office or at home. They have designated days in the office for team collaboration, meetings or specific tasks that require in-person presence. 
2. Rotation - with a rotational approach, people alternate between working from home and in the office following a predetermined schedule. For example, the team works remotely for 2 weeks then in the office for 2 weeks. This combines collaboration and flexibility without the pressure of your team having to create their own routines.

Since hybrid work is still fairly new, there are so many other variations out there. Ultimately, teams should work closely with each other to determine what is best for overall performance. Don’t be afraid to explore these models with your own team to find the best way forward.

## The Future of Remote Work: Final Thoughts

The digital age has transformed the way we work, leading companies worldwide to embrace remote working arrangements. While it offers great freedom, it also presents unique challenges. If you’re lucky enough to be able to work internationally, remember to respect the local labor laws and cultural norms. Thanks to tech, we can explore, stay connected and make a living from anywhere.
